Breakout Game
=========

###Description##

This was a project for the class CS317 at the university of Strathclyde. The class focuses on mobile development and the issues it creates in terms of user interaction. It is more about the design rather than development, hence the web app.

This project is a simple game where the user controls a paddle which bounces a ball. The user can then clear the squares above.

For this project we where required to not use any frameworks, e.g. JQuery Mobile
